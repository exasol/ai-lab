    "The code above shows how the model works on a toy example. However, the main purpose of having a model deployed in the database is to get a quick response for a batch input. The performance gain comes from two factors - localization and parallelization. The first means that the input data never crosses the machine boundaries. The second means that multiple instances of the model are processing the data on all available nodes in parallel.\n",

For example, if we wanted to get a label with the highest score for each row of the input table `MY_TEXT_TABLE`, where the text in question is in the column `MY_TEXT_COLUMN`, the SQL would look similar to this:\n",
