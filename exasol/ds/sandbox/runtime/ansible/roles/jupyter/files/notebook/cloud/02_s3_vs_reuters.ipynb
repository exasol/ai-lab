    "To configure the virtual schema, we need the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an S3 Connection object, which specifies in which S3 bucket our data resides. Our dataset is on a public S3 bucket, so no S3 credentials are needed. If your data is not open to the public, you need to store credentials in the Connection object.\n",
    "2. Put the EDML file into the Bucket FS. EDML describes the mapping between the JSON structure and the desired Virtual Schema tables and columns. In our case, the mapping is simple, as every JSON file describes an individual news article with the same set of columns. However, EDML supports more complex scenarios, like table references, foreign keys, and missing columns. You can find more details [in the documentation.](https://github.com/exasol/virtual-schema-common-document/blob/main/doc/user_guide/edml_user_guide.md)\n",
    "3. Create a Virtual Schema with the S3 Connection object and the EDML file in the Bucket FS. After this step, new virtual tables are added to Exasol, and every query from them performs S3 data read."
