    "To use a model with the Transformer Extension one needs to download it from the Huggingface Hub and put it into the [BucketFS](https://docs.exasol.com/db/latest/database_concepts/bucketfs/bucketfs.htm). Please refer to the Transformer Extension <a href=\"https://github.com/exasol/transformers-extension/blob/main/doc/user_guide/user_guide.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">User Guide</a> to find more information about model loading functionality it provides.\n",

    "The first method requires the database machine to have internet access. The second method provides a workaround if this is a problem.
