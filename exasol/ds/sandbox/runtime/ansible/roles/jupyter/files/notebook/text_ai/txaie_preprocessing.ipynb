    "Here we will demonstrate how the Text AI Extension data-preprocessing can be used. We will be taking a dataset of customer support tickets, which contain unstructured data in the form of a ticket description. We will then run our preprocessing in order to sort these tickets into \"uregent\" and \"not urgent\" cases, and find imortant named etities and keywords within the text. This found information cane then be used for data analysis in the [following notebook](). \n",

    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing, or the processing of so called \"unstructured data\" or free text, is the processing(i.e classifying, retreivig of information) of unannotated language.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP) which seem easy to us humans, but are very hard for a machine to do. For example infering the opinion the speaker has about a topic (Opinion Extraction/Mining). Doing these tasks on un-annotated text is even harder. Therefore, multiple ways to annotate a natural laguage text with various additional information where developed. These annotated texts are then better suited for higher level NLP tasks.\n",
    "                                                                                                                                                   \n",
    "Depending on the amount of data/text which should be processed, annotating by hand is mostly not an option these days, since with increasing dataset sizes the resources needed quickly become unrealistic. Therefore, Exasols Text AI provides you with preprocessing steps you can use for annotating you data in various ways.\n",

    "A topic in this context is an abstract category of text. Given that a document is about a particular topic, it is expected for particular words to appear in the document more or less frequently. However, it is not required for the exact words to describe the topic to be found in a text. This means that topics can be infered, even if their name/description/topic synonyms are not found in the data.\n",

It can also be used with Zero-Shot Classification models, which can assign classes/topics which have not been seen during the training.

    "Similar to the TOPIC_CLASSIFIER_VIEW, the NAMED_ENTITY_VIEW also has the Span(TEXT_DOC_ID, TEXT_CHAR_BEGIN, TEXT_CHAR_END) identifing the input document the entity was found in. Then there are the found named entity itself in the \"ENTITY\" column, as well as an entity type and an entity score the model assigned the entity. Additionally we also have an identifying span for the entity itself :ENTITY_DOC_ID, ENTITY_CHAR_BEGIN, ENTITY_CHAR_END. This Span represents exactly where in our input data this entity was found. \n",
