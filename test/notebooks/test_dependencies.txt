# exasol/ds/sandbox/runtime/ansible/roles/jupyter/files/notebook_requirements.txt
# currently declares dependency exasol-notebook-connector==0.4.0 which in turn
# depends on script-languages-container-tool 0.19.0.
#
# The dependency to exasol-pytest-backend above in turn depends on
# exasol-integration-test-docker-environment [required: >=3.1.0,<4.0.0] which
# leads to installing ITDE 3.3.0 which removes module upload_file_to_db.
#
# In consequence ./test/notebooks/nbtest_script_languages_container.py fails.
#
# The following additional dependency fixes this.

exasol-integration-test-docker-environment==3.2.0
