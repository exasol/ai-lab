    "The code above shows how the model works on a toy example. However, the main purpose of having a model deployed in the database is to get a quick response for a batch input. The performance gain comes from two factors - localization and parallelization. The first means that the input data never crosses the machine boundaries. The second means that multiple instances of the model are processing the data on all available nodes in parallel.\n",

One possible use case would be collecting statistics of token occurrence in say customer reviews, where each review is stored in a separate row. For example, if the text to be tokenized is stored in the column `MY_TEXT_COLUMN` of the table `MY_TEXT_TABLE` and we want to get the counts of the top 10 tokens, the SQL would look similar to this:\n",
