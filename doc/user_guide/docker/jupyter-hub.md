# AI Lab in JupyterHub environment

[JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub) is a popular way to organize multi-user access 
to jupyter environments. If your organisation is using or plan to use JupyterHub to 
provide different groups of users access to the pre-configured jupyter environments, you might 
find this document relevant.

This is not a complete detailed manual about JupyterHub setup and configuration - this topic is wide
and well beyond to the scope of this document. In addition, support of JupyterHub in AILab is 
very experimental and you might face some issues and limitations. This document is rather 
a draft, describing how AI Lab docker container could be plugged in JupyterHub environment. 
Where needed, we'll give a links to the JupyterHub documentation for further reading.
If you face some problems, don't hesitate to file a [bug report](https://github.com/exasol/ai-lab/issues).
