# AI Lab in a JupyterHub Environment

[JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub) is a popular way to manage multi-user access 
to Jupyter environments. If your organization is using or planing to use JupyterHub to 
provide different groups of users access to the preconfigured Jupyter environments, you might 
find this document relevant.

This is not a complete detailed manual about JupyterHub setup and configuration - this topic is broad
and well beyond the scope of this document. In addition, support of JupyterHub in AI Lab is 
very experimental and you might encounter some issues and limitations. This document is rather 
a draft, describing how the AI Lab docker container can be integrate into the JupyterHub environment. 
Where needed, we provide links to the JupyterHub documentation for further reading.
If you face some problems, don't hesitate to file a [bug report](https://github.com/exasol/ai-lab/issues).
