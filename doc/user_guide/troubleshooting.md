# Troubleshooting

## Kernel died when initializing the Transformers Extension

### Problem

Running the Transformers Extension Initialization in the transformers/te_init.ipynb notebook results
in a pop-up error message similar to this: "Kernel Restarting. The kernel for transformers/te_init.ipynb
appears to have died. It will restart automatically."

### Cause

The issue is caused by an insufficient memory, either RAM or the free disk space. This, for example,
can be observed when running the AI-Lab from certain restricted EC2 instances, e.g.T2.medium.

### Solution

Make sure the available resources satisfy the minimum [system requirements](system-requirements.md).
