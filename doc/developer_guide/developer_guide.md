# Exasol AI-Lab Developer Guide

## Overview

The overall idea of this project is to set-up an AWS EC-2 instance, using cloudformation templates, then install all
dependencies via _Ansible_, generate an AMI image based on the final EC-2 instance, and finally export the AMI image to
the virtual image formats.
