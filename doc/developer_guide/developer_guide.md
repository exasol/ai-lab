# Script-Languages-Developer-Sandbox Developer Guide

## Overview

The overall idea of this project is to set-up an AWS EC-2 instance, using cloudformation templates, then install all dependencies via _Ansible_, generate an AMI image based on the final EC-2 instance, and finally export the AMI image to the virtual image formats.

## Requirements

This package requires:
* Python (>=3.8)
* Poetry (>=1.2.0)
* Docker (for integration tests)
* AWS CLI

## Setup

### Install githooks

Run the following command before development.

```shell
cd githooks
bash install.sh
```

## Design Goals

script-languages-developer-sandbox uses AWS as backend, because it provides the possibility to run the whole workflow during a ci-test.

This project uses 
- `boto3` to interact with AWS
- `pygithub` to interact with the Github releases
- `ansible-runner` to interact with Ansible.  
Proxy classes to those projects are injected at the CLI layer. This allows to inject mock classes in the unit tests. 
A CLI command has normally a respective function in the `lib` submodule. Hence, the CLI layer should not contain any logic, but invoke the respective library function only. Also, the proxy classes which abstract the dependant packages shall not contain too much logic. Ideally they should invoke only one function to the respective package.


## Commands

There are generally three types of commands:

| Type | Explanation | 
| ----- | --------- |
| Release Commands | used during the release | 
| Deployment Commands | used to deploy infrastructure onto AWS cloud | 
| Development Commands | used to identify problems or for testing | 

### Release commands

The following commands are used during the release AWS Codebuild job:
- `create-vm` - creates a new AMI and VM images
- `update-release` - updates release notes of an existing Github release
- `start-release-build` - starts the release on AWS codebuild 

### Developer commands

All other commands provide a subset of the features of the release commands, and can be used to identify problems or simulate the release:
- `export-vm` - creates a new VM image from a running EC2-Instance
- `install-dependencies` - starts an ansible-installation onto an existing EC-2 instance
- `reset-password` - resets password on a remote EC-2-instance via ansible
- `setup-ec2` - starts a new EC2 instance (based on an Ubuntu AMI)
- `setup-ec2-and-install-dependencies` - starts a new EC2 instance and install dependencies via Ansible
- `show-aws-assets` - shows AWS entities associated with a specific keyword (called __asset-id__)
- `start-test-release` - starts a Test Release flow
- `make-ami-public` - Changes permissions of an existing AMI such that it becomes public 

### Deployment commands

The following commands can be used to deploy the infrastructure onto a given AWS account:
- `setup-ci-codebuild` - deploys the AWS Codebuild cloudformation stack which will run the ci-test
- `setup-vm-bucket` - deploys the AWS Bucket cloudformation stack which will be used to deploy the VM images
- `setup-release-codebuild` - deploys the AWS Codebuild cloudformation stack which will be used for the release-build
- `setup-vm-bucket-waf` - deploys the AWS Codebuild cloudformation stack which contains the WAF Acl configuration for the Cloudfront distribution of the VM Bucket 

## Flow

The following diagram shows the high-level steps to generate the images:

### Setup EC2

Creates an EC2 instance based on an Ubuntu AMI via AWS Cloudformation. It also creates a new keypair dynamically.
After the export has finished, the cloudformation stack and the keypair is removed.

### Install

Installs all dependencies via Ansible:
- installs Poetry
- installs and configures Jupyter
- installs Docker and adds the user `ubuntu` to the docker group
- clones the script-languages-release repository
- changes the netplan configuration. This is necessary to have proper network configuration when running the VM image

Finally, the default password will be set, and also the password will be marked as expired, such that the user will be forced to enter a new password during initial login.
Also, the ssh password authentication will be enabled, and for security reasons the folder "~/.ssh" will be removed.

### Export

The export creates an AMI based on the running EC2 instance and exports the AMI as VM image in the default formats to a S3 bucket.

## Release

The release is executed in a AWS Codebuild job, the following diagram shows the flow.

## AWS S3 Bucket

The bucket has private access. In order to control access, the Bucket cloudformation stack also contains a Cloudfront distribution. Public Https access is only possibly through Cloudfront. Another stack contains a Web application firewall (WAF), which will be used by the Cloudfront distribution. Due to restrictions in AWS, the WAF stack needs to be deployed in region "us-east-1". The WAF stack provides two rules which aim to minimize a possible bot attack:

| Name                 | Explanation                                                                             | Priority | 
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| VMBucketRateLimit    | Declares the minimum possible rate limit for access: 100 requests in a 5 min interval.  | 0        | 
| CAPTCHA              | Forces a captcha action for any IP which does not matcha predefined set of IP-addresses | 1        | 



## Involved Cloudformation stacks

The following diagram shows the involved cloudformation stacks:
![image info](./img/cloudformation-stacks.drawio.png)

"DEVELOPER-SANDBOX-VM-SLC-BUCKET", "DEVELOPER-SANDBOX-CI-TEST-CODEBUILD" & "DEVELOPER-SANDBOX-RELEASE-CODEBUILD" are permanent and need to be deployed using the "deploy" commands (see [commands](#deployment-commands)).
The EC2-stack lives only during the creation of a new developer sandbox image.

## Tagging

Each of the involved resources might cause costs: cloudformation stacks, AMI, EC2 key-pairs.
To enable you to keep track of all these resources, the implementation tags them after creation with a specific keyword (called __asset-id__).
The S3 objects are identified by the prefix in the S3 bucket. The command tags only the dynamically created entities with the asset-id but not the permanent cloudformation stacks.
You can use the command `show-aws-assets` to get a list of all assets which were created during the execution.
This is very useful if an error occured.
If the creation of a sandbox finished normally it is expected to have only the AMI, images (S3 objects) and the export tasks (one for each image) listed.


## How to contribute

The project has two types of CI tests:
- unit tests and integration tests which run in a Github workflow
- A system test which runs on a AWS Codebuild

Both ci tests need to pass before the approval of a Github PR.
The Github workflow will run on each push to a branch in the Github repository. However, the AWS Codebuild will only run after you push a commit containing the string "[CodeBuild]" in the commit message.
