# Exasol Data Science Sandbox

## Overview

This project provides an automated mechanism to build and export virtual machines images (AWS AMI, VMDK,...)
enabling users to try out data science algorithms in Jupyter notebooks connected to the the Exasol database.

## Where to find the VM images

The release process will automatically store the links to the images in the [release notes](https://github.com/exasol/data-science-sandbox/releases/latest), as there will be a specific AMI per release.
Please check the user guide about details of the image.
