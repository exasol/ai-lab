# Overview

This project provides an automated mechanism to build and export virtual machines images (AWS AMI, VMDK,...)
which can be used to develop new script-languages container for the Exasol DB.

## Where to find the VM images

The release process will automatically store the links to the images in the [release notes](https://github.com/exasol/script-languages-developer-sandbox/releases/latest), as there will be a specific AMI per release.
Please check the user guide about details of the image.
